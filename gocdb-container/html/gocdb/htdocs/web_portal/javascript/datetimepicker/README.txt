The datetime picker version current used is from (v2.1.20): 
Website: http://tarruda.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/ 
GitHub: https://github.com/tarruda/bootstrap-datetimepicker
Warning, this old version does not support the full API or events! 

Note, you'll notice that the above is no longer supported and has moved to: 
Website: http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/
GitHub: https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker
The date time picker therefore needs to be updated.
