This directory contains transactional service layer functionality as per a 
service facade in a typical 3 tiered web app (e.g. layer between the user interface and the database).

For example this stores the functions to add and update service endpoints in the database. 
The code here is generic so that in future it can be used with input from regional GOCDBs.

A short description of a service layer is available here:  http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html
