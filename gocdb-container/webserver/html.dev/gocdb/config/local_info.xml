        do not explicitly specify the 'scope' parameter e.g. 'get_site' would return
        all sites that define the default scope.
        If default scope is NOT provided, PI queries that do not explicitly specify
        the 'scope' parameter will return all results regardless of scope, e.g.
        'get_site' would return all sites in all scopes.

        scopes are specified in a PI query using the 'scope' parameter and when the
        'scope_match' PI parameter is not explicitly specified. For example,
        in this query: 'getSite&scope=EGI,EUDAT,SCOPEX' should sites be returned
        that define all or any of the specified scopes?

        Specify a list of RESERVED scope tag names:
        - New Reserved tags can only be directly assigned to resources by the gocdb-admins
         (resources include NGIs, Sites, Services, SGs but not Projects - don't currently need to tag projects)
        - When creating a new child resource (e.g. a child Site or child Service),
          the scopes that are assigned to the parent are automatically inherited and assigned to the child.
        - Reserved tags assigned to a resource are optional.
        - Users can reapply Reserved tags to a resource ONLY if the tag can be
          inherited from the parent ScopedEntity (parents include NGIs/Sites).
        - For Sites: If a Reserved tag is removed from a Site, then the same tag is also removed
          from all the child services - a Service can't have a reserved tag that
          is not supported by its parent Site.
        - For NGIs: If a Reserved tag is removed from an NGI, then the same tag is NOT
          removed from all the child Sites - this is intentionally different from the Site->Service relationship.
