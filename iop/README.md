# IOP
Helm charts to deploy the IOP on Kubernetes.

## Modifications
These charts are heavily based on CESNET's work. Modifications were made to run on our own Kubernetes cluster.

**Note:** These files are not _in-sync_ with the official ScienceMesh charts; they are only meant for testing purposes and to work with the Phoenix web interface.
