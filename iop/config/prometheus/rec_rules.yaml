# -- Health checking recording rules --

# For every service, a boolean is calculated based on fixed rules for each of the three possible states (OK, WARN, CRIT).
# This value is then multiplied by 1, 2, or 3, respectively. The maximum value of these three determines the overall service status.

# Notes:
#   The min operator acts as a logical AND operation
#   The max operator acts as a logical OR operation
